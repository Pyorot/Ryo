LIST OF EX-RAID ELIGIBLE GYMS (NO GUARANTEES ON ACCURACY YET)

Gym data from pokemongomap.info compiled by moriakaice: https://gist.github.com/moriakaice/f7b40e018add45f15485a4b9325543fa.
All gym coordinates rounded to 6dp (which I think is in-game native precision).
Gyms tested for Ex-eligibility (ExE) using this query: http://overpass-turbo.eu/s/uYm.
Classification done via osmcoverer with native gym coords and the above test (as per Silph report).
Cells are S2 level 12 – ex-raid uniqueness cells.
Cells numbered as rectangular lattice (x,y; increasing towards N,E) with 0,0 = Needle/Trafalgar Square/Westminster.
